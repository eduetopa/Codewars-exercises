# 🧠 Codewars - Solved Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to programming challenges from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), solved in different difficulty levels (`kyu`) and various programming languages(python for the moment), and the tests I develop for the challenges. I use this repo to practice, improve my logic, and strengthen my knowledge.
